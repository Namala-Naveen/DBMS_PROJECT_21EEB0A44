# Movie Tickets Management System
We have decided to make a database about movie
tickets and theatres by looking at the craze in the 
public towards Indian cinemas.
A movie ticket database is a collection of information
regarding movie tickets that have been sold or
reserved. It includes information such as the movie 
title, showtime, theatre location, ticket price, seat 
number, and customer information. This information 
can be used to manage the number of tickets sold , 
track attendance, payment transactions and analyse 
customer behaviour. The database can be stored in a
computer system which reduces the work load on 
humans.
